### Frontend for web application
In order to communicate with the API, it is necessary to use the HTTP protocol. For this purpose, it was decided to use the popular Axios library, which makes it much easier to send requests and receive HTTP responses.

##### User interface
Two categories of users can be distinguished in the project, the first is an unlogged user, i.e. a guest, and the second is a logged in user acting as an administrator. Access to functionality varies depending on the role acquired.
